The short course is approaching, and we have made lots of improvements since [the last release](hide-variables).

* The code panel is resizeable - drag the sliders to make it take more or less space
* Warnings and errors are now indicated with symbols at the line they occur at in the editor
* Users can download the summary results of sensitivity analysis
* Help is available in the application, currently for writing code only
* Users can create saved parameter sets, in order to compare several versions of a model at once
* More feedback is provided on long-running actions such as fitting a model or running sensitivity
* Details about the integration can be controlled; setting maximum step sizes and also times that the solver must not jump over

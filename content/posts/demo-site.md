We have added a new demo site to the epimodels deployment at [`epimodels.dide.ic.ac.uk/demo`](https://epimodels.dide.ic.ac.uk/demo) which shows off the main features of Wodin and information on configuration; you'll probably want to refer to this when building a site. The [underlying source repo](https://github.com/mrc-ide/wodin-demo-config) may be a useful resource when building a deployment too.

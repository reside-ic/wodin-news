This is the result of more than half a year&amp;rsquo;s work, porting over the functionality from our original initial Shiny application, initially developed for the 2019 Mathematical Models of the Epidemiology &amp;amp; Control of Infectious Diseases short course but since showing its age.
With this version, we support creation of simple ODE models, exploring these models with interactive graphs, investigating sensitivity to changes in parameters and fitting models to data using least squares.</description></item></channel></rss>

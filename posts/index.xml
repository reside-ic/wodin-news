The code panel is resizeable - drag the sliders to make it take more or less space Warnings and errors are now indicated with symbols at the line they occur at in the editor Users can download the summary results of sensitivity analysis Help is available in the application, currently for writing code only Users can create saved parameter sets, in order to compare several versions of a model at once More feedback is provided on long-running actions such as fitting a model or running sensitivity Details about the integration can be controlled; setting maximum step sizes and also times that the solver must not jump over</description></item><item><title>Hide Variables</title><link>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/hide-variables/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 09:35:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/hide-variables/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re working on a complex model there are often variables that need to exist in the model that are needed to solve your model, but are not that interesting. Worse - sometimes these variables make your graph unreadable because they&amp;rsquo;re on a really different scale (e.g., the number of susceptible individuals in a disease that never reaches a very high level in a population).
As of wodin 0.3.0, you can now select variables to show from below the editor, on the Code tab:</description></item><item><title>Lots of small interface tweaks</title><link>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/wodin-0-2-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 17:10:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/wodin-0-2-0/</guid><description>While working towards getting stochastic models running, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a number of relatively smaller interface improvements that smooth over a number of rough edges.
Sum of squares is now shown in the Run tab if you have a &amp;ldquo;fitting&amp;rdquo; app and it is possible to compute it All plots have x axis labels; these show Time for plots over time, and the parameter being varied in the other sensitivity plots Sensitivity will not lock up the browser as badly if the model run is slow, and will display progressively as it computes each iteration Long labels are not truncated, particularly in the sensitivity plots It is possible to display plots with a log-y axis (this setting will be automatically shared across all plot types and saved with the session) A slightly nicer workflow for creating a new session based on the contents of your current saved session</description></item><item><title>Demo Site</title><link>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/demo-site/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 11:18:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/demo-site/</guid><description>We have added a new demo site to the epimodels deployment at epimodels.dide.ic.ac.uk/demo which shows off the main features of Wodin and information on configuration; you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to refer to this when building a site. The underlying source repo may be a useful resource when building a deployment too.</description></item><item><title>Initial release</title><link>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/initial-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 13:51:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://reside-ic.github.io/wodin-news/posts/initial-release/</guid><description>We have made the initial release of Wodin, with the basic app running the first practical for the MSc course &amp;#x1f389;
This is the result of more than half a year&amp;rsquo;s work, porting over the functionality from our original initial Shiny application, initially developed for the 2019 Mathematical Models of the Epidemiology &amp;amp; Control of Infectious Diseases short course but since showing its age.
With this version, we support creation of simple ODE models, exploring these models with interactive graphs, investigating sensitivity to changes in parameters and fitting models to data using least squares.</description></item></channel></rss>
